    "# Competitive Pokemon Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The original Pokemon analysis notebook was written when I first learned Pandas. The way I use the library has evolved over the years, so this notebook merely updates the code to reflect those improvements (WIP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Competitive Pokemon is a game where players construct teams of pokemon with moves, natures, items, etc to battle other live players. In this turn-by-turn game, the objective is to make all (typically 6) of your opponents pokemon faint. Not all Pokemon are equal for this purpose, so based on the usage statistics of the pokemon in competitive play, they are split into various tiers. A player may use a Pokemon to compete in a particular tier if the pokemon is in that tier or below. Historically, usage of various pokemon by players has changed overtime with the introduction of new pokemon, moves, abilities, and mechanics. So, Pokemon are constantly shifted between tiers to maintain balance. You can learn move about competitive pokemon here: https://www.smogon.com/dp/articles/intro_comp_pokemon\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we will attempt to classify pokemon into the competitive 6v6 tiers based on the properties of the Pokemon themselves. This classification task is extremely difficult to do accurately, even for someone who is well versed in competitive Pokemon."

Let's create two indicator features: one for if a pokemon is a mega-evolution, and another for if a pokemon is an alternate form. Although alolan forms are technically alternate forms, they are really different pokemon with similar stats and movepools. For the purpose of this analysis, alolan forms will be considered seperate pokemon."

    "We did some further feature consolidation by combining like moves in our model selection. We also used a Lasso to identify what features were useful and which were not. Ultimately, we decided to drop all moves we did not consolidate from our featureset. After some model selection, we chose a Gradient Boosting Regression Tree, due to it's ability to learn complex relationships to reduce the bias in our model.\n",

Competitive pokemon tiers are based on human behaviour, and pokemon tiers change all the time (in fact, halfway through this analysis, Claydol was promoted to NU!). We found that Pokemon our model severely misclassified often carved their niche in the tiers they are in. These complex combinations of abilities, moves, stats, and typing were difficult for our model to learn about, due to the limited volume and type of data. Some of the Pokemon our model slightly misclassified actually used to be in the tiers our model predicted!\n",

It would be an interesting task to build a model that is able to understand the relationships between pokemon on a team to build a team that has synergy. A step beyond that would be to build a model to actually battle with its team."
