# Competitive Pokemon Analysis
My goal was to scrape and analyze data about competitive pokemon then classify pokemon into tiers through machine learning. 

The "data collection" folder the scripts used to scrape Smogon, Bulbapedia, and Veekun for the pokemon data. The "K-Modes Models" folder contains pickled versions of the k-modes with a varying number of modes for the move clustering.
